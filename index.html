                    for specific applications. Codes are used for data compression, cryptography, error detection and
                    correction, data transmission and data storage.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Data compression attempts to remove unwanted redundancy from the data
                from a source in order to transmit it more efficiently. For example, ZIP data compression makes data
                files smaller, for purposes such as to reduce Internet traffic. Data compression and error correction
                may be studied in combination.

                Error correction adds useful redundancy to the data from a source to make the transmission more robust
                to disturbances present on the transmission channel. The ordinary user may not be aware of many
                applications using error correction. A typical music compact disc (CD) uses the Reed Solomon code to
                correct for scratches and dust. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Cryptography, or cryptology (from Ancient Greek: κρυπτός, romanized:
                kryptós "hidden, secret"; and γράφειν graphein, "to write", or -λογία -logia, "study", respectively), is
                the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior.
                More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or
                the public from reading private messages. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the
                disciplines of mathematics, computer science, information security, electrical engineering, digital
                signal processing, physics, and others.Core concepts related to information security (data
                confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation) are also central to cryptography.
                Practical applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital
                currencies, computer passwords, and military communications.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Error detection and correction</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In information theory and coding theory with applications in computer
                science and telecommunication, error detection and correction (EDAC) or error control are techniques
                that enable reliable delivery of digital data over unreliable communication channels. Many communication
                channels are subject to channel noise, and thus errors may be introduced during transmission from the
                source to a receiver. Error detection techniques allow detecting such errors, while error correction
                enables reconstruction of the original data in many cases.Good error control performance requires the
                scheme to be selected based on the characteristics of the communication channel. Common channel models
                include memoryless models where errors occur randomly and with a certain probability, and dynamic models
                where errors occur primarily in bursts. Consequently, error-detecting and correcting codes can be
                generally distinguished between random-error-detecting/correcting and burst-error-detecting/correcting.
                Some codes can also be suitable for a mixture of random errors and burst errors. </p>
